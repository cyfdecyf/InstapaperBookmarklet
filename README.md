**InstapaperBookmarklet** is a browser extension to run Instapaper's [read later bookmarklet](http://www.instapaper.com/extras).

### Why another Instapaper extension?

- I like the visual feedback of the read later bookmarklet
- I hide bookmarks bar in browsers, but I want quick access to the bookmarklet

### Feature

- Add a button in the toolbar
- When clicked, run Instapaper bookmarklet on current page
  - If current page has no URL, open Instapaper [unread page](http://www.instapaper.com/u)

### Setup

1. Download and install
   - [Safari](http://chenyufei.info/p/InstapaperBookmarklet/InstapaperBookmarklet.safariextz)
   - Chrome waiting to be published
2. Open Instapaper [extras page](http://www.instapaper.com/extras) (make sure you <strong>have logged in</strong>)
3. Right click on the bookmarklet and **copy link address**
4. Paste link address into InstapaperBookmarklet's settings
   - Safari: Preferences -> Extensions
   - Chrome: Just click the added button

### Note

The extension needs to inject the bookmarklet into your open page to execute, that's why it asks for the permission to access your data on all websites.

For Safari: immediately after installation, the button will only work on new open page.
